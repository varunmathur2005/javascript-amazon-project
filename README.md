    Description:
    Amazon clone project, a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web development, 
    as I replicated the user interface and functionality of the renowned e-commerce platform. The HTML structure ensures a well-organized layout, 
    while CSS brings the design to life with a polished and responsive appearance. 
    Developed key features such as dynamic product listings, and an interactive shopping cart/checkout page.
